# Note Nest

Note Nest is a clean, lightweight note-taking application built with Flutter. It implements a complete CRUD workflow with local persistence, theming, and cross-platform support across mobile, web, and desktop.

---

## Key Features
- Create, read, update, and delete notes
- Local persistent storage using a lightweight wrapper (see `lib/local_storage.dart`)
- Provider-based state management for simplicity (`lib/notes_provider.dart`)
- Clean UI with theme support (`lib/theme/`)
- Cross-platform builds (mobile, web and desktop)

## Local Storage & Data
Note Nest stores data locally so users can maintain their notes without a backend. See `lib/local_storage.dart` for how notes are serialized and deserialized, and how the storage lifecycle is managed.
